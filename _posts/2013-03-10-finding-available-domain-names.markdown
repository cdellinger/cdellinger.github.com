title: Finding Available Domain Names
summary: Came across a service for finding available domain names that I absolutely love, its called Bust A Name.  To use the service you choose several keywords that you would potentially like in your domain name and it checks out all the available permutations.

Came across a service for finding available domain names that I absolutely love, its called [Bust A Name](http://www.bustaname.com/ "Bust A Name").  To use the service you choose several keywords that you would potentially like in your domain name and it checks out all the available permutations.  This is 100 times better than the old one at a time domain lookups Iâ€™ve previously performed.  Take a moment to check this site out and let me know what you think.
