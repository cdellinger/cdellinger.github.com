#####  How To Find Out The Name Of A Font

Have you ever seen a font you really love but are unsure what it actually is?  Yesterday I ran into an issue where I had a logo created by a contractor who is long gone and I needed to know what font he used in the logo.  How hard could that be?  Well after about ten minutes of searching I quickly realized there are way more fonts in the world than I ever realized and that I didnâ€™t know enough about this space to do a keyword search to find my mystery font.  Tiring of a manual search I wondered if there were any free tools on the web to help identify fonts.  One quick Google search and voila, I found [WhatTheFont](http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ "What The Font"), a free tool on [myfont.com](http://www.myfonts.com/ "MyFont.com") which quickly found my font with a minimal amount of work for me.  All I needed to do was upload an image of the font in question, so in my case I stripped out the word in the logo and saved it as a png file.  I then uploaded and the site tried to identify what the image was saying.  In my case it guessed 100% correct, but in case it was unable to, the sites gives you the ability to tell it what the word(s) say by overriding their guess.  Once I had completed that, WhatTheFont gave me a list of guesses for what my mystery font was and sure enough its top/best guess was exactly what I was looking for!  This tool was a lifesaver.
